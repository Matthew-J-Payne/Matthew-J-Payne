### I'm an Earth Observation scientist passionate about using Python to develop solutions for our Planet ðŸŒ±
Take a look here at an article I published in *Nature Reviews Earth & Environment* - https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-021-00159-7

#### I am currently developing Geospatial Algorithms for deployment in AWS
Developing these geospatial processes is refreshing as the use-case is very streamlined and is designed to work from specific inputs. 

#### I successfully defended my PhD thesis and am awaiting acceptance of my corrections.
My thesis was titled - "Exploring the deforestation dynamics of oil palm expansion in the Central Peruvian Amazon".  
In this thesis, I used satellite imagery to explore the promotion of deforestation by oil palm expansion, the drivers of oil palm expansion from deforestation and mapped oil palm using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) at an unprecedented spatial resolution.

#### I have developed the successor to the Earth Observation repository, `pyeo`.
Pyeo (https://github.com/clcr/pyeo) is a near-real-time (NRT) deforestation monitoring library (*some literature - https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/3/707*). The library also acts as a way to query, specify Region of Interest (ROI) and download Sentinel-2 imagery using the Copernicus DataSpace Ecosystem (CDSE).
