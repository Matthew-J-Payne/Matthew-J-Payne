### Current Projects

- Mapping agriculture across Nigeria to understand the ideal locations for renewable energy units.
- Evaluating whether the spectral signature of Wheat affected by the Wheat Blast fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae, can be scaled to the remote sensing scale, enabling efficient mapping of the disease.
- Mapping the deforestation footprint of oil palm in tropical forests (South America, Central Africa and South-East Asia)

### Past Projects
#### I developed the successor to the Earth Observation repository, `pyeo`.
Pyeo (https://github.com/clcr/pyeo) is a near-real-time (NRT) deforestation monitoring library (*some literature - https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/3/707*). The library also acts as a way to query, specify Region of Interest (ROI) and download Sentinel-2 imagery using the Copernicus DataSpace Ecosystem (CDSE).

### Qualifications
#### I successfully defended my PhD thesis and graduated in January 2024.
My thesis was titled - "Exploring the deforestation dynamics of oil palm expansion in the Central Peruvian Amazon".  
In this thesis, I used satellite imagery to explore the promotion of deforestation by oil palm expansion, the drivers of oil palm expansion from deforestation and mapped oil palm using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) at an unprecedented spatial resolution.
